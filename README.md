# Random Location Generator + Tracker #

## Overview ##
This app allows the user to generate and travel to a random location on an interactive, zoomable map, using the Google Maps API.

If the user likes the random location they've ended up in, clicking the marker pin will save that location to a list that includes the latitude and longitude coordinates for future reference.
